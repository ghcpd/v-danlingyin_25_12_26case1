Defect ID: CODE-001
Description: The retry function implementation has a bug causing infinite retries on consistent failures.
Failing example: retry(() => Promise.reject(new Error('fail')), { retryCount: 1 })
Error trace: Function retries indefinitely instead of stopping after 1 attempt.
Suggested fix: Modify the retry logic to properly track and limit attempts, e.g., by passing remaining retries recursively or using a loop.
